# About Me

<img src="images/profile7.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Hanyang Zhong (Hanyang, é’Ÿç¿°æ‰¬)**.

I am a second-year PhD candidate in the School of Electronic Engineering at the University of York in the UK. My research interests encompass Large Language Models, Multi-modality, 3D Reconstruction, SLAM and Embodied AI. I am currently conducting doctoral research under the supervision of Professor Mark Post, investigating the integration of large language models with robots and Multi-agent SLAM system.  

My background includes experience as a researcher in Professor Post's lab at York, where my focus has been on advancing the state-of-the-art in language model capabilities for robotic platforms. I have a passion for interdisciplinary research that bridges LLM, Embodied AI, and 3D Reconstruction. 

I would be delighted to discuss potential collaborations or my research in more detail. Please feel free to email me if you would like to connect further (hanyang.zhong@york.ac.uk).

- **March 2024ï¼š** Our work *FENet: Focusing Enhanced Network for Lane Detection* has been accepted to [ICME 2024](https://2024.ieeeicme.org/#/) as an Oral paper. See you in Canada! [Preprint version download](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17163#/)ðŸ”—
- **Jan 2024:** Becoming an **ICME reviewer**!
- **Dec 2023:** I posted a preprint on arXiv titled "[**LLM-SAP: Large Language Model Situational Awareness Based Planning**](https://github.com/HanyangZhong/Situational_Planning_datasets)" exploring the use of LLMs to enable context-aware robot planning. I welcome constructive feedback, related perspectives, and relevant citations from the community as I continue developing these ideas at the intersection of language models, robotics, and embodied intelligence. Please reach out if you see potential connections to your own research - I believe open collaboration can advance this emerging field.
- **Dec 2023:** I posted the preprint "[**FENet: Focusing Enhanced Network for Lane Detection**](https://github.com/HanyangZhong/FENet)" on arXiv. This paper proposes a novel neural network approach to improve lane detection capabilities in autonomous driving. I welcome constructive feedback, relevant perspectives, and citations from the community as I continue refining this method. Please reach out if you see potential connections to your own work at the intersection of computer vision and autonomous systems - open collaboration can advance this important field.
